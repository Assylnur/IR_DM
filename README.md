# Information Retrieval and Data Mining

Course covers major information retrieval and data mining terminology, algorithms, algorithm synthesis, distance functions, feature engineering and standardization, n-dimensional space operations and application domains. Course teaching consists of lectures, practical tasks, practical assignments and the final project.  

- Assignment 1: Text similarity and Agglomerative Document Clustering.
- Assignment 2: First part related with KNN, second is K-Means Clusteing (Without using libraries).
- Assignment 4: Unsupervised learning. K-means, Hierarchical Clustering. With different metrics, linkages. Visualize the clusters etc..
- Assignment 5: Supervised learning. Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest. Tune the hyper parameters, grid search, cross validation etc. Visualization of the models etc..
